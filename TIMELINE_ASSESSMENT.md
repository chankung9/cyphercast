## üö® Critical Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Reward System Complexity
**Impact:** HIGH | **Probability:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** Designing fair reward formulas is complex and time-consuming.

**Mitigation:**
- Use **simplest possible formula** for MVP:
  ```
  Winner Share = (Winner Stake / Total Winner Stakes) * (Total Pool * 0.95)
  Creator Fee = Total Pool * 0.05
  ```
- Document advanced formulas as "future work"
- Focus on ONE prediction type (binary outcome)

---

### Risk 2: Smart Contract Bugs
**Impact:** CRITICAL | **Probability:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** Financial logic bugs could lock funds or allow exploits.

**Mitigation:**
- **Extensive testing** with Anchor test suite
- Use **well-tested patterns** (no custom cryptography)
- Start with **small test amounts** on Devnet
- **Code review** checklist for security issues
- Consider using **program upgrade authority** for post-hackathon fixes

---

### Risk 3: Frontend Integration Issues
**Impact:** HIGH | **Probability:** HIGH

**Issue:** Wallet integration and RPC calls can be finicky.

**Mitigation:**
- Use **official Solana Wallet Adapter** (battle-tested)
- Test with **multiple wallets** (Phantom, Solflare)
- Have **detailed error messages** for debugging
- Use **Devnet RPC endpoint** from reliable provider (Helius, QuickNode)
- Keep UI simple - avoid complex state management

---

### Risk 4: Time Overruns
**Impact:** CRITICAL | **Probability:** HIGH

**Issue:** 9 days is tight for full-stack development.

**Mitigation:**
- **Cut scope aggressively** - MVP only
- **Reuse templates** where possible:
  - Anchor program templates
  - Solana dApp starter kits
  - UI component libraries (Tailwind, shadcn)
- **Work in parallel** if multiple developers:
  - Dev 1: Smart contract
  - Dev 2: Frontend
- **Daily standups** to track progress
- **Have a Plan B**: Minimum viable demo even if features are incomplete

---

### Risk 5: Infrastructure Issues
**Impact:** MEDIUM | **Probability:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** Devnet might be slow, RPC limits, deployment issues.

**Mitigation:**
- **Set up infrastructure early** (Day 1-2)
- **Use reliable RPC providers** with high rate limits
- **Have backup Devnet wallets** with SOL
- **Document deployment process** for reproducibility
- **Test deployment multiple times** before final submission

---

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Adopt "Working Demo First" Approach**
- Prioritize end-to-end flow over feature completeness
- Better to have a simple system that works than complex one that's broken
- Focus on proving the core concept

### 2. **Leverage Existing Tools & Templates**
- Don't build from scratch what already exists:
  - Use Solana Playground for quick prototyping
  - Start from Anchor program templates
  - Use Solana dApp Scaffold for frontend
  - Leverage UI libraries (don't design from scratch)

### 3. **Simplify Reward Logic**
- Start with basic winner-takes-all (minus creator fee)
- Document advanced distribution as "roadmap item"
- Focus on making ONE scenario work perfectly

### 4. **Focus on Storytelling**
- Demo video is crucial for judges
- Show a **compelling use case**:
  - "Live sports prediction"
  - "Gaming tournament outcomes"
  - "Creator challenge competitions"
- Emphasize **Solana advantages** in video:
  - Show transaction speed
  - Highlight low fees
  - Demonstrate transparency (Solana Explorer)

### 5. **Document Limitations Transparently**
- Be honest about what's MVP vs. production-ready
- Show awareness of security considerations
- Demonstrate understanding of scale challenges
- Outline clear roadmap for post-hackathon
