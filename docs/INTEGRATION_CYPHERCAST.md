## Integration Summary

The cyphercast integration aligns Codex HQ planning artifacts with the Solana-based interactive streaming dApp.  
This record tracks how documentation, engineering policies, and audit workflows connect between HQ (`codex-agent`) and the downstream repo (`../cyphercast`).

### Integration Checklist

- [x] Project registered in `docs/PROJECTS.md`
- [x] HQ workspace scaffold created under `projects/cyphercast/`
- [x] Frontend/Web3 upskill guide drafted (`FRONTEND_UPSKILL_GUIDE.md`)
- [x] Engineering best practices defined (`ENGINEERING_BEST_PRACTICES.md`)
- [x] Enterprise software policy published (`SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_POLICY.md`)
- [x] Governance roles mapped in `projects/cyphercast/docs/RACI.md`
- [x] Downstream docs synchronized (legacy CLI + vault guides ingested; governance docs mirrored)
- [ ] Integration smoke checklist executed after doc parity confirmed

### Validation Evidence

1. **HQ Workspace Bootstrap (2025-10-31 01:30 UTC+07)**  
   Created project directories (`docs/`, `tasks/`, `scripts/`), doc-sync tooling, and README guidance for side-by-side repo layout.
2. **Engineering Enablement Artifacts (2025-10-31 01:45 UTC+07)**  
   Authored upskill, best practices, and policy references to standardize React + Solana development and enterprise controls.
3. **Governance Matrix (2025-10-31 01:50 UTC+07)**  
   Established RACI assignments covering feature delivery, security reviews, and audit reporting.
4. **Doc Sync Diff (2025-10-31 01:52 UTC+07)**  
   Ran `projects/cyphercast/scripts/doc_sync_diff.sh ../cyphercast`; diff indicated downstream repo contained additional documentation (CLI quick reference, vault playbooks). Follow-up captured in audit log.
5. **Doc Parity Achieved (2025-10-31 02:05 UTC+07)**  
   Imported downstream docs into HQ, mirrored HQ policies downstream, and reran doc sync diff (clean). Logged completion in `audit/logs/2025-10-31.md`.

### Next Steps

1. Engineer agent: Execute integration smoke checklist (wallet connect, staking flow, log capture) post-doc parity and record evidence.
2. Product agent: Align cyphercast roadmap entries in `.codex/plan.yaml` and ensure tasks reference new policies.
3. Compliance agent: Review `SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_POLICY.md` and confirm wallet security controls meet requirements.
4. All agents: Validate doc-sync checklist completion and archive evidence in `audit/logs/`.
