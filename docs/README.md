# Cyphercast Documentation Hub

Codex HQ maintains upstream documentation for the cyphercast project here before synchronizing updates to the downstream repository.

- Capture architecture notes, release plans, and integration checklists in this directory.
- Use `projects/cyphercast/scripts/doc_sync_diff.sh ../cyphercast` (from the Codex HQ repo) to compare docs across repos.
- If you are viewing this from the downstream repo, run the script from the HQ checkout or ensure updates stay in sync manually.
- Record sync results with timestamps (Asia/Bangkok) in `audit/logs/<date>.md`.
