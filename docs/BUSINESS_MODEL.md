# CypherCast Business Model

## Vision
CypherCast transforms passive viewing into an interactive, value-sharing economy. Live-stream audiences place predictions on moments that matter, creators earn from every engagement spike, and the platform captures sustainable upside through tips and treasury growth. The MVP (Phases 1–2.5) proves that this loop works entirely on-chain with transparent accounting.

## Stakeholders & Value Exchange
| Stakeholder | Pain Today | CypherCast Benefit |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------ |
| **Creators / Streamers** | Reliance on ads & sporadic donations | Earn a programmable **tip** on every prediction pool and unlock long-term upside via a Community Vault share |
| **Viewers / Fans** | No ownership in the moments they hype | Stake SPL tokens, earn proportional rewards, and build status through provable wins |
| **Platform / DAO** | Hard to monetize without extracting value | Collect configurable fees (`tip_bps`) and route them into a transparent treasury for future growth |
| **Partners / Sponsors** | Limited data on engagement quality | Access live analytics from emitted events and offer sponsored prediction pools |

## Revenue Mechanics
- **Streamer Tip (Phase 2.5)** – A percentage of the total stake is paid to the creator when the stream is resolved. The percentage (`tip_bps`) is enforced by the on-chain program and logged for reporting.
- **Community Vault Contributions** – Optional split of tips or sponsorship deposits flow into a DAO-controlled vault to fund platform incentives, tournaments, or marketing.
- **Premium Experiences (Planned)** – Phase 3 introduces wallet-gated overlays, sponsored moments, and subscription tiers that can be enforced by smart contracts.

## Network Effects
1. **High engagement loops** – Predictive moments encourage real-time participation, increasing average watch time and repeat visits.
2. **Transparent payouts** – On-chain settlement builds trust with fans, encouraging higher stakes and viral sharing.
3. **Composable data** – External developers can build leaderboards or analytics dashboards directly from program events.

## Go-To-Market Milestones
- **Phase 1** – Demonstrated technical feasibility (streams, predictions, reward claims) using CLI and automated tests.
- **Phase 2** – Added SPL token vault, security hardening, and end-to-end payouts.
- **Phase 2.5** – Introduced proportional rewards, dynamic configuration, and monetization hooks required for investor conversations.
- **Phase 3 (Planned)** – Ship the public dApp, integrate wallet adapters, and launch creator pilots.

## Competitive Edge
- **Speed & Costs** – Solana finality enables sub-second confirmation for microstakes at negligible fees.
- **Composable Finance** – Treasury balances and prediction data are reusable for DeFi integrations or sponsorship NFTs.
- **Regenerative Incentives** – Every interaction feeds either creators or the community vault instead of a centralized operator.

## Measuring Success
- **Engagement KPIs** – Average predictions per viewer, stake volume, and claim rates from the analytics pipeline.
- **Revenue KPIs** – Total tip volume, community vault inflows, and creator ARPU.
- **Product KPIs** – Number of active streams, retention of winning viewers, and conversion from observers to stakers.

## Investor Takeaway
CypherCast is more than a streaming add-on—it is a programmable engagement layer where every stake drives immediate value for creators and the platform. The architecture is production-ready for monetization, and the roadmap outlines clear levers to scale into a self-sustaining marketplace.
