# Architecture Decision Records — cyphercast

Use this directory to capture significant technical decisions.  
File naming convention: `ADR-XXXX-short-title.md` where `XXXX` is zero-padded sequence (e.g., `ADR-0001-state-management.md`).

## Workflow

1. Draft decision using the template (`ADR_TEMPLATE.md`).
2. Circulate for review (Engineer + Product + Compliance when security-sensitive).
3. Update status (`Proposed` → `Accepted`/`Superseded`) once consensus reached.
4. Reference ADRs from relevant PRs, docs, and audit logs.
